I‚Äôm Jano Gonz√°lez, a Senior Software Engineer with over 15 years experience.

My past experience includes the design, implementation and operation of large
scale distributed systems, driving large projects with many stakeholders,
mentoring engineers and presenting complex ideas in a simple and engaging way
to both technical and non-technical audiences.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Looking a for a new job üëÄ

I'm looking for Senior and Staff Software Engineer opportunities in Berlin
around September.

I prefer working in cross functional teams that use short delivery cycles for
rapid feedback, in companies that create their own products.
The engineering problems of B2C companies with large amounts of traffic are
specially interesting for me, where I can bring my experience in the backend
and infrastructure domains.
