I’m Jano González, a Senior Software Engineer with over 15 years experience.

### Availability

I'm looking for Senior and Staff Software Engineer opportunities in Berlin
around September.

I prefer working in cross functional teams that use short delivery cycles for
rapid feedback, in companies that create their own products.
The engineering problems of B2C companies with large amounts of traffic are
specially interesting for me, where I can bring my experience in the backend
and infrastructure domains.
